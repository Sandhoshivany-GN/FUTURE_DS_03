# Student Event Feedback Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes feedback collected from students on college events like tech fests, workshops, and cultural activities.  
The goal is to identify satisfaction trends, uncover improvement areas, and provide actionable insights for future events.

## Features
- Clean and preprocess survey data
- Perform sentiment analysis to understand student satisfaction
- Identify trends and insights from survey responses
- Visualize results using charts
- Provide recommendations for event improvement

## Skills Gained
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Sentiment analysis using NLP
- Extracting insights from survey responses
- Data visualization
- Survey data collection using Google Forms

## Tools and Libraries
- **Google Colab** – Online Python environment
- **pandas** – Data manipulation and cleaning
- **TextBlob / VADER** – Sentiment analysis
- **seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Google Forms (CSV)** – Survey collection

## Dataset
- Survey responses collected via Google Forms
- Exported as a CSV file and imported into Colab for analysis

## Workflow
1. Load survey data into a pandas DataFrame
2. Clean and preprocess data (handle missing values, standardize responses)
3. Perform sentiment analysis on text responses
4. Aggregate and visualize satisfaction trends
5. Identify key areas for improvement
6. Generate insights and recommendations for event organizers

## Future Enhancements
- Use advanced NLP techniques for deeper sentiment analysis
- Build an interactive dashboard for dynamic exploration of results
- Predict satisfaction trends for upcoming events based on historical data

## How to Run
1. Upload the survey CSV file to Google Colab
2. Run the data cleaning and analysis scripts
3. View visualizations and sentiment insights
4. Use insights to inform event planning decisions
